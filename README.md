# First Pytest Exercise: mean()

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/nickdelgrossofirst_pytest_exercise)](https://repl.it/github/nickdelgrosso/first_pytest_exercise)


## Goal

Exercise: Write and test your own **mean()** function using pytest. 

  1. Write at least 3 different cases to check that it works.
  2. Compare your mean() function with NumPy's mean() function.  Do you get the same results?
  
## Getting Pytest to Work

  1. Install Pytest.
    - In Replit, this can be done by:
    
      - simply importing Pytest and running the script, 
      
      - or clicking the ![](img/replit_package_icon.png) logo and typing "pytest" in the text box.
      
  2. `pytest` is a shell command.  To run it, 
  
      - open the shell window by clicking the "Shell" button in the upper-right corner ![](img/replit_shell_icon.png). 
    
      - type `pytest main.py`.
    
  3. By default, Pytest will run any files that begin with the word "test" and will run any functions that begin with the word "test".
